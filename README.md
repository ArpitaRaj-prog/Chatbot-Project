# Chatbot Project

This is a simple rule-based chatbot built using Python and NLTK. The chatbot can respond to basic user inputs and simulate a simple conversation. This project was created as a part of my learning journey in Python programming and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Features:

-Rule-based chatbot responses
-Basic conversation handling
-NLP processing using NLTK library
-Easy to run on any machine
-Simple and beginner-friendly


## Technologies Used:

-Python 3.x
-NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
-Git (for version control)
-Visual Studio Code (or any code editor)
